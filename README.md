# Text To Search

This Go application finds all occurrences of a specified subtext within a given text and print their positions.

It performs case-insensitive matching by converting both the input text and subtext to lowercase.


## Usage

1. Modify the `textToSearch` variable with the text in which you want to search for subtexts.
2. Populate the `subtexts` slice with the subtexts you wish to find.

### Run the application

```bash
go run main.go
```
or

```bash
make run
```
